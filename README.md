### Hi there! I'm Ryan ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ“š I'm studying Computer Science at Wentworth Institute of Technology
- ðŸ”­ I have two projects on my radar
  - My main project at the moment is [titanfall2-rp](https://github.com/IncPlusPlus/titanfall2-rp). It adds [Discord's](https://discord.com/) [rich presence functionality](https://discord.com/rich-presence) to [Titanfall 2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1237970/Titanfall_2/). This is done by reading the memory of the running process to find certain values such as scores, game mode, and the current map.
  - My other large project is called `bigtoolbox`. It's a library of little utilities I've made for myself. This is on hold while I work like mad on BetterStat. This project doesn't have a goal and was an excuse for me to experiment with Maven and Maven Central. I'm focusing right now on `bigtoolbox-network` at the moment which _does_ have a goal, _to provide a near-native network configuration API in Java on Windows, Linux, and Mac OS_. It's in a very messy state right now (it's not for the faint of heart) because I'm rewriting the Windows component and creating a Linux component. This is currently archived while I focus on other things.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning React and Typescript.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about implementing an API versioning solution for a Spring MVC application without breaking Swagger (yes, that's very specific for a reason)
- ðŸ“« I can be easily reached via the email displayed on the left side of my profile (this will be near the top of the page on mobile)
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
- âœ¨ Fun fact: I _love_ Source Engine games because I like how the movement feels. Favorite games include Titanfall 2, CS:GO, and Project M.
