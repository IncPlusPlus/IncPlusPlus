### Hi there! I'm Ryan ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ“š I'm studying Computer Science at Wentworth Institute of Technology
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™ve been working on two projects lately
  - My main project at the moment is called [BetterStat](https://github.com/IncPlusPlus/betterstat). It is a project that aims to create a Nest-like smart thermostat targeted towards DIY enthusiasts who want to truly own their device. It's a combination of a Java web server using the Spring Framework, a Flutter mobile app, and an Arduino/ESP32 thermostat.
  - My other large project is called `bigtoolbox`. It's a library of little utilities I've made for myself. This is on hold while I work like mad on BetterStat. This project doesn't have a goal and was an excuse for me to experiment with Maven and Maven Central. I'm focusing right now on `bigtoolbox-network` at the moment which _does_ have a goal, _to provide a near-native network configuration API in Java on Windows, Linux, and Mac OS_. It's in a very messy state right now (it's not for the faint of heart) because I'm rewriting the Windows component and creating the Linux component.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Flutter and Dart.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m excited to have recently made a contribution to [weisJ/auto-dark-mode](https://github.com/weisJ/auto-dark-mode) with [weisJ/auto-dark-mode#8](https://github.com/weisJ/auto-dark-mode/pull/8)! My only OSS contributions up to then were documentation nitpicks to various projects ðŸ˜›
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™ve been planning to learn JS for some time but I'll probably need a new project to learn it with (or I might pick it up while working at a new job ðŸ‘€)
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about implementing an API versioning solution for a Spring MVC application without breaking Swagger (yes, that's very specific for a reason)
- ðŸ“« I can be easily reached via the email displayed on the left side of my profile (this will be near the top of the page on mobile)
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
- âœ¨ Fun fact: I _love_ Source Engine games because I like to bunnyhop. I also like Project M.
